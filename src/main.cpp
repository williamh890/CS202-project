main.cpp contains the game RenderWindow object, as well as stores a vector of pointers to Screens objects (pure virtual).
New screens are declared in main and stored the the Screens vector by reference; additional screens can be implemented in
main by adding the appropriate header file include, creating a new screen object (must inherit from Screens.h) and storing
it in the screens vector.
The runtime loop manages screens by setting the screenSelect to a value return by each screen's run function.
